## Amazon Accounts



## AWS Resources

Follow these steps to create the required AWS resources.

### Amazon S3 bucket

Create an Amazon S3 bucket in your local AWS region (e.g. ap-southeast-2) to store the CDR files. Group files into Amazon S3 bucket files by their schema type, so files of one type should go in their own folder.

* Create a folder: call-detail-records-mock
* Copy the CDR csv files from the data folder to your Amazon S3 bucket
